## Tips to get started on ServiceNow development

1. [Sign up for a ServiceNow account](https://signon.service-now.com/x_snc_sso_auth.do#/sign-up)
2. [ServiceNow Basics](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/rome/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_buildmyfirstapp_rome_servicenow_basics_objectives) - highly recommended, even if you already have some experience as an agent in the UI. This learning plan covers:
  - how to set up your own personal development instance
  - navigating around the UI
  - two important UI components: 
    - **lists** and using filters to narrow query results
    - **forms** and editing records
3. (Optional) [Request a personal instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do) and match the version of your  organization's ServiceNow instance
